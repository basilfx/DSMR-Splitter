## Dimensions
The enclosure measures approximately 66 x 46 x 21 mm.

## Print Settings
Print both parts in PETG at 0.2 mm layer height with 20% infill. Both parts can
be clamped together with M3x10 mm or M3x15 mm self-tappening screws.

## Post processing
The screws can be sunken into the part. You might need to carefully drill the
holes to match your screws.

A small hole can be drilled for the light tube. A small piece of transparant
plastic can be used, e.g. 1.75 mm transparant filmanet.
